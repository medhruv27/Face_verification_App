so basically i made a app using react native in which when two faces are detected using react native face detector  
1st face coming from idcard second face coming from the person holding the id card if twofaces are detected the particular frame is sent to server 
backend which runs locally using flaskapi then the photos are verified using deepface now i wanted to deploy this on aws so i chose a path that photos will 
come through api gateway given to s3 which acts as a trigger function for ecs ehich has docker container in it which gives the result to dynamo db for that particular user ...
for the second part i have done runned the python py file using docker by making its image now how can i  proceed after this do after this
