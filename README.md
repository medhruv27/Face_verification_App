#Worker Uniform Detection using YOLO
Overview
This project utilizes YOLOv8, an advanced version of the YOLO (You Only Look Once) model, for detecting worker uniforms in images and videos. The goal is to accurately identify and localize specific types of uniforms worn by workers in various settings.
#Features
YOLOv8 Implementation: Utilizes YOLOv8, an optimized and improved version of YOLO for object detection tasks.
Multi-Class Detection: Capable of detecting multiple types of worker uniforms simultaneously.
Customizable: Easily extendable to detect new types of uniforms by retraining on additional data.
Performance: Designed for real-time and efficient detection tasks.
